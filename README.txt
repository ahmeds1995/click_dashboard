I'm thrilled to share my first interactive dashboard which contains insights about "Click" fictional company dataset, which specialized in hardware sales.

Project Processes: 

1 - Data Collection: 
	I downloaded the sql dump files which contain unclean data for the company.
2- Data Exploratory : 
	* Understand the data, and what is it talking about, and the content of every column in the four tables (customers, markets, 	products, date, transactions).
	* Ask effective questions to narrow down the scope of analysis and focus on specific aspects of the data that are relevant to project 	objectives.
3- Data Cleaning : 
	Data cleaning process included : 
   	 * remove duplicated currency in currency column.
   	 * normalize the sales amount column to be in INR, since some 
     	  values were in USD.
   	 * delete sales amount that are less than or equal to 0, since it does 
     	  not make sense.
4- Data Analysis: 
	After data cleaning, i saved the sql file and imported it in power bi desktop and create some measures to analyze the data and 	obtain insights and patterns within the data . 
5- Data Visualization :
	Finally, I created an interactive dashboard which shows the findings in a visual form.


Software Used:

	* SQL Server Managment Studio (SSM) : For data exploratory, and 
 	data cleaning processes.
	* Power BI Desktop : For data trsformation, data analysis, and data 
	 visualizaion by creating an interactive dashboard.
